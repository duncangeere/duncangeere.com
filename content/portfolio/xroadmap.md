The Exponential Climate Action Roadmap was a major scientific report, published 13 September 2018 at the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco. The roadmap outlines the global economic transformation required by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement on climate, defining clear actionable goals for all sectors of society. 

I was responsible for editing together the work of more than a dozen authors into a single, compelling voice, defining the structure, look and feel of the report, and managing all layout and production tasks.
