Recently, I was at the ["Artistes et Robots"](https://www.grandpalais.fr/fr/evenement/artistes-robots) exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris, and I stumbled across a lovely artwork by [Vera Molnár](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r). Molnár was a pioneer of computer art, and on the wall in the gallery was one of her Structure de Quadrilatéres, created with an algorithm, a plotter and pen. I loved its simplicity and purity, and it seemed like it might be both fun and a good level of challenge to replicate to teach myself how Observable works. I documented my process of figuring out how to replicate, then animate, the artwork in [an Observable notebook](https://beta.observablehq.com/@duncangeere/structure-de-quadrilateres) that you can read and edit yourself.

Subsequently, some friends of mine at [Craft Labs](https://craftlabs.se/) here in Gothenburg asked if they could use my Quadrilatéres on the label of a beer they'd brewed. The results looked pretty good:
