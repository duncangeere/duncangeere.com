A DIY statistical analysis tool for Eurovision.

![](/img/portfolio/eurovisionparty.jpg)

Every year, I invite a collection of friends over for a Eurovision finals party, and every year I ask them to score each entry out of ten in terms of songwriting, performance and staging.

Last year, I went through the results and put together a [detailed statistical analysis of everyone's votes](http://www.duncangeere.com/eurovision2018/) - picking an overall winner, a winner in each category, the most and least generous voters, who best represented Europe's final rankings, and who voted similar to each other.

This year I went a step further and used Javascript and D3 to build [an online tool](https://observablehq.com/d/2fff68606d692649) that lets *anyone* analyse their own Eurovision party in the same way.

If you have any suggestions to improve it, please shoot me an email or (better still) leave me a pull request in Observable itself.
