BBC Wildlife Magazine approached me based on my work for BBC Science Focus for an article that examines a key question around environmental science - are there too many people?

The full article was published in the May 2019 issue of BBC Wildlife magazine. It isn't yet online, but when it is I'll add a link to this page.
