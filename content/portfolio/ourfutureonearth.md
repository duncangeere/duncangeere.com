Data visualisation for a report on humankind's environmental impact.

![](/img/portfolio/ourfutureonearth.png)

I worked on data visualization for a new Future Earth report that connects recent news events with the latest environmental science research. Here's how it's described in the report itself:

> This report provides a snapshot of our world at the start of 2020, helping to make sense of the state of this unique biophysical-human ecosystem we inhabit as a planetary-changing species. It combines up-to-date research with the latest world events, including physical and social science perspectives to explore where we are now, where we hope to go, and how we might get there. It also includes a novel survey of scientists to rank their top concerns for global systemic risks in the coming years.
