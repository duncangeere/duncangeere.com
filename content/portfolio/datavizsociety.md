The [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/) is a professional organisation which supports people working in information design. 

I've been a member since launching earlier this year, taking a substantial volunteer role in three major areas - editing for the society's Medium publication, [Nightingale](https://medium.com/nightingale), participating in the communications technology working group to try and find the most effective ways of communicating with the membership, and acting as a moderator for many of the channels in the DVS Slack workspace.

It's a great group of people, doing great work for the community. You can join [here](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/join).
