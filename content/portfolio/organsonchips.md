Development of an simulation showing how an organ-on-a-chip works.

![](/img/portfolio/organsonchips.jpg)

For an [article about organs on chips](https://series.howwegettonext.com/all/simulating-organs-on-chips/) on How We Get To Next, I developed a small simulation that readers can use to gain a clearer understanding of how an organ-on-a-chip works. Make sure you give the [interactive version](https://series.howwegettonext.com/all/simulating-organs-on-chips/) a go.

As well as the development of the simulation, I commissioned and edited the article. The interactive was illustrated by [Eden Brackenbury](http://edenbrack.com/) and coded by [The Dataface](http://thedataface.com/).
