Visualizing the world's international fishing fleets.

For the [14th Data for a Cause challenge](https://www.olgatsubiks.com/single-post/2019/03/17/Winners-of-the-14th-Data-For-A-Cause-Challenge), I visualized the world's international fishing fleets. I used a range of different charts as part of a story-driven approach. You can see the resulting interactive slideshow [here](https://public.flourish.studio/story/26396/).

I used Python/Pandas to analyse the seven million rows of data in the dataset, and the [Flourish platform](http://www.flourish.studio) to visualise the resulting analysis.

In Other Waters [won the 2nd place spot](https://www.olgatsubiks.com/single-post/2019/03/17/Winners-of-the-14th-Data-For-A-Cause-Challenge) in the final challenge results.
