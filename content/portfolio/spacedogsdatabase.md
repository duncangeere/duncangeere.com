I put together a [database of space dogs and missions that they flew on](https://airtable.com/universe/expG3z2CFykG1dZsp/sovet-space-dogs) based on the lists in the back of Olesya Turkina's book "Soviet Space Dogs".

I'm working on a few visualisations of the data, but if you create and publish something based on the database then please [email and let me know about it](mailto:radio.edit@gmail.com).
