For the [Thin Layer podcast](https://howwegettonext.com/the-thin-layer-42f18ce55638) on How We Get To Next, I wrote and developed an [interactive explainer on neglected tropical diseases](http://interactive.howwegettonext.com/neglected-tropical-diseases/) using D3.js and MapboxGL. The source code can be found [on Github](https://github.com/howwegettonext/ntds).

The article was illustrated by [Eden Brackenbury](http://edenbrack.com/).
