After seeing [my header illustration](https://howwegettonext.com/solar-trains-could-help-us-rethink-energy-7ae4c008f021) for a How We Get To Next on solar trains, climate charity 10:10 asked me to develop more for a report they were putting together on the subject, titled [Riding Sunbeams](https://1010uk.org/riding-sunbeams-report). I also used open-source mapping software QGIS to produce a series of maps for the report. You can see them all below.
