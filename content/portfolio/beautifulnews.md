The biggest project I worked on in 2019 is [Beautiful News](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/). It's a collection of 365 data visualizations - released daily for a year - showing how the world is becoming a better place. I coordinated and managed the team working on the project from the start of production - and I also contributed in terms of sketching and developing concepts, researching data, designing the graphics, developing the audience for the project, and perfecting the editorial elements.

You can follow the project [on the web](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/), [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/beautiful__news) and [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beautifulnews.daily/).
