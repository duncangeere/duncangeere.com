A YouTube channel documenting my pen plotter experiments.

For a few years I’ve been looking for an excuse to start a YouTube channel, and I’ve found it with my Axidraw V3/A3 pen plotter.

Plottervision is a collaboration between myself and [Silvia Huttner](https://twitter.com/silfaz?lang=en). We post regular videos of our work, including how-tos, experiments, and long, relaxing, more complex plots that can be more than an hour.

The channel also includes my Dataplotter series, where I use my plotter to tell data stories. It's been [described as](https://twitter.com/Jasonforrestftw/status/1259830144207917056) "Like watching Hans Rosling at his first TED talk except with a digital pen plotter."
