Writing, development and data visualisation for a visual essay on the world's endangered languages.

As part of [the ID Question series](https://howwegettonext.com/the-id-question-6fb3b56052b5) on How We Get To Next, I explored Unesco's [Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger](http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php) in a visual essay that shows how languages are disappearing around the world. Readers were able to read about how languages are categorised, identify their nearest endangered language, and explore a world map of more than 2,000 diappearing languages. [Check it out here](https://interactive.howwegettonext.com/endangeredlanguages/).

This was a major coding project which employed Javascript, D3.js, MapboxGL and TopoJSON. I wrote the majority of the code and the text of the essay, and managed the project from start to finish. [Eden Brackenbury](http://edenbrack.com/) designed and laid out the page, and [Ian Steadman](https://twitter.com/iansteadman) wrote the languages in profile. The source code for the entire project can be [found on Github](https://github.com/howwegettonext/endangeredlanguages).

Finally, you can read a little about some of the choices I made while putting it together on the [Storythings blog](https://storythings.com/how-we-made-our-disappearing-languages-data-visualization-d9f22e0580c).
