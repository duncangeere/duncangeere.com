A map of mid-00s indie band influence.

![](/img/portfolio/timeforheroes.png)

I grew up in an amazing era of music, and ran indie discos for many years. I wanted to map out the lines of artistic and commercial influence between the various bands of the mid-00s indie scene.

So I [put a visualization together](https://www.duncangeere.com/timeforheroes/) over a period of a few weeks. I mapped it out roughly on paper, then put it together in Sketch, curving all the lines manually. It took a while, but I'm really happy with the results.
