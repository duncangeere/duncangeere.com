BBC Focus, the BBC's science and technology magazine, asked me to [investigate Volkswagen's "Dieselgate" emissions-cheating scandal](http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/cars/emissions-scandal-dieselgate). Here's an excerpt:

> But will Dieselgate translate into long-term change, and perhaps even the end of diesel as a fuel, or will we be back to business as usual within a year? “There will be some small effect but probably not a big one,” says Tate. “The thing that could make a big difference is what city authorities can do. The motor industry, whilst it has the lobbying power to influence the European Commission, has it got the lobbying power to go around all the major cities?”
