A travelogue of a research trip to the Arctic circle.

I spent ten days in a polar research base beneath Swedenâ€™s highest mountains, which gave me a fascinating glimpse into how the Arctic is changing. I saw how the ice affects the ground, plants and animals, and what may happen if it begins to disappear.

The Arctic is changing fast. While every part of the world is projected to experience climate change, the Arctic is expected to warm faster than anywhere else, which will have dramatic effects on its fragile ecosystems.

I wrote up a [brief travelogue of my trip](https://maptia.com/radioedit/stories/the-changing-arctic) for Maptia.
