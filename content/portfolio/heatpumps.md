The climate charity [10:10](https://1010uk.org/) asked me to write a short, simple explainer for a general audience on how heat pumps work, for use in a report looking into the potential to harvest heat energy from London's hidden underground rivers.

The results were published [in the report](http://files.1010global.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/LostRivers_heat_seeking_report.pdf), and also [on the web](https://1010uk.org/articles/what-on-earth-is-a-heat-pump) and in a brochure used to publicise the report.
