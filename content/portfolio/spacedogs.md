Earlier in the year I put together a [database of space dogs and missions that they flew on](https://airtable.com/universe/expG3z2CFykG1dZsp/sovet-space-dogs) based on the lists in the back of Olesya Turkina's book "Soviet Space Dogs".

I've now finished the first of perhaps several visualizations of the data. You can check it out [here](http://www.duncangeere.com), alongside a detailed FAQ.
