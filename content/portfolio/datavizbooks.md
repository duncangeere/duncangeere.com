There are a lot of books about data visualization. With the help of the Data Visualization Society, the IIB team and I put together a comprehensive, filterable list of the best creative work, curated collections, how-to manuals and theory guides. Check it out [here](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/dataviz-books/).
