A series for the official Minecraft website, covering every block in the game.

From 2017 to 2018 I wrote a weekly article for the [official Minecraft website](http://www.minecraft.net). Half game-guide and half pop-science-for-kids, the series covered a different block each week, detailing what it's used for in the game and what it's used for in real life.

Unfortunately there's no index of articles, but you can browse through some [with a Google search](https://www.google.se/search?q=%22block+of+the+week%22&oq=%22block+of+the+week%22&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l4.5052j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and it's pretty easy to find one for a specific block.

The series gathered a fanbase of hundreds of thousands of readers, who campaigned endlessly for us to feature Note Block. When we [finally did](https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/block-week-note-block), as a finale to the series, we commissioned a song to celebrate from  Note Block musician KristinaGaming. Thanks Kristina!
