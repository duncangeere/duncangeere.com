![Duncan Geere](/img/about.jpg)

I'm a data-driven journalist, editor and designer with more than 10 years of experience. I cover the intersection of science, technology and culture, with a particular interest in environmental issues.

I'm currently working as a senior creative producer at Information is Beautiful, and my freelance clients have included  Wired, BBC Wildlife, Nesta, Technology Review, FutureEarth, Popular Science, NME, PC Gamer, Techradar and Men's Health.

All my business operations are 100% carbon-negative. I reduce my emissions annually, and the rest are covered by [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/) offsets.

Originally from the UK, now based in Sweden.
