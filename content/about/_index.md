I'm a writer, editor and data journalist with more than 10 years of experience. I cover the intersection of science, technology and culture, with a particular interest in environmental issues.

I'm currently working as a senior editor at Information is Beautiful, and I've contributed freelance work to publications like Wired, BBC Focus, Technology Review, Popular Science, NME, PC Gamer, Techradar and Men's Health.

Originally from the UK, now based in Sweden.
